* I collaborated with Gannon, John, Michael

* The main learning point for this project was to be able to create a website that used a database and to be able to create, read, update, and delete data to and from the database. To do all of this you would need to create a front-end and back-end of the site, so the data can be interacted with on the website.

* I contributed the registration and topic controllers, routes, and forms to allow students to register. On the admin portion I contributed the rooms, sessions, and schedules controllers, routes, and forms. I set up the admin section to function with the tabs, as well as helped with the student, schools, topics, and presenters controllers, routes, and forms. 

* One challange that I ran into during this project was not being very familiar with async. To overcome this I used the documentation on the async site and then went back and looked at previous projects that used it. After that it took a little practice but I was able to become very comfortable with it. Another challange was tracking data and having querys with mongoose not work. To help with mongoose I used the online documentation and to track data I used basic webpages so I did not have to worry about putting the data in the right spot and getting it there at the same time. The last major issue was using GitHub and having everyones commits work together. To solve this we combined our code together while we were physically together, but only on one computer so we could work together to solve any issues. 

* In the admin section schedules needs to include presenters. There is also an issues when upodating students, if update is choosen and you do nothing with the school input it will not carry over with the rest of the update. If I had more time I would add a section for the admin to be able to use custom searchs of the database with the results filling a table. I would also like to add the ability to export data from the site as a pdf or excel file. The last two things I would add arr the ability to create a roster for scheduled events and create a login for the admin to secure their abilities. 

* I would approach this project with more planning if I was to do it again. When working as a group everyone has to be on the exact same page so we can function at our highest level. If better planning was done there would be no guessing on how someone was going to do their portion and if help is needed on a different part everyone would know exactly how it is supposed to function or look.
